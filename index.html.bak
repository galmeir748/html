<h2><u><b><i>My job</i></b></u></h2>
<img  src="images/my job.jpg" class="center"/id="imgfamily"><br/>
<div>I am a FireFighter for 6 years, my job is very dangerous in that time I have been in many car accidents,Fires, Gas leak and more...<br/>
About one year ago in a Fire in the field with alot of vegetation that risks houses near by, I fell on my shoulder and dislocated my shoulder and had a Surgery and couldn't work for a year.<br/>
This job is not for everybody you need to be a team player, sometimes need to take hard choices alone and under pressure.<br/>
In our line of duty you expose to some unfortunately horrors after car accidents, fires and more, and you need to be strong enough to carry on.<br/>
